# OCR for Driving Liscence

The following program is designed to work as a OCR model to extract relevant information from images of Vehicle Registration Certificates.

To extract text from images the program used Py-tesseract in its default mode after some operations on images have been performed such as thresholding and blurring to reduce noise and increase contrast between text and the background, making it easier for the tesseract to extract text from the image.
